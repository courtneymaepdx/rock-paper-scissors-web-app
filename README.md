Rock, Paper, Scissors
Recreate the game Rock, Paper, Scissors in a website. This can be a two player game, so there would be two 'plays' in each round. Write a method that can handle the different combinations of plays and make sure to write specs for all possible combination of plays. Build a website, styled with CSS, where someone can go to play your game.
